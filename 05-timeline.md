# The Timeline Is Not What You Think

Most public discussion of AI and economic disruption oscillates between two endpoints: "everything is fine, we've always adapted" and "robots take all the jobs." Neither is useful, because neither describes the transition period that the next ten to twenty years will actually be.

### 2025–2032: The Wage Compression Phase

AI does not eliminate jobs wholesale in this period. It fragments them. A law firm needs one paralegal instead of four. A radiology department supervises AI reading ten times more scans with the same staff. A marketing team of twelve becomes a team of three with AI tools. Net employment may not crash, but wage pressure becomes severe in knowledge work for the first time in modern history. The data is already visible: the unemployment rate for recent college graduates exceeded 9% in December 2025, and a Wall Street Journal survey in October 2025 found only 20% of workers reported confidence in their ability to find a job.[^19]

Simultaneously, the first wave of humanoid robots enters controlled environments—warehouses, factories, structured logistics—at the scale and pace documented in the previous section.

The political significance of this phase is enormous: it is the first time automation directly threatens both the blue-collar labor force and the college-educated professional class simultaneously.

### 2032–2040: General Deployment

Humanoid robotics and autonomous vehicles have proven their reliability across millions of hours of commercial operation. The deployment expands from structured environments into semi-structured and unstructured ones—retail, food service, construction, agriculture, last-mile delivery.

The economics become self-reinforcing: each generation of robots trains the next generation's AI models through operational data, while simulation environments compress the training cycle at extraordinary rates—DeepMind's MuJoCo-Warp accelerates robotics machine learning workloads by a factor of seventy. The gap between "research prototype" and "commercial deployment" closes from years to months.

By this point, structural unemployment is difficult to disguise through gig work and statistical reclassification.

### The Energy Bottleneck

The entire automated economy runs on electricity. The United States currently generates roughly 4,000 terawatt-hours annually. Conservative projections for AI compute demand alone suggest the need to double or triple total generation capacity by 2035–2040, before adding autonomous vehicle fleets, robotic manufacturing, and automated agriculture.

Permitting a single nuclear plant in the U.S. takes ten to fifteen years. Solar and wind face transmission constraints. The energy infrastructure buildout required for full automation is on the scale of the post-World War II industrial expansion, and we currently have neither the regulatory framework nor the political consensus to execute it at that speed.

### The Robotics Scaling Curve

There is a specific inflection point in the deployment of physical automation that deserves attention, and the data from the embodiment pipeline suggests it is arriving faster than expected.

The adoption threshold can be stated precisely. A humanoid robot's fully loaded cost per productive hour—purchase price amortized over operational life, plus energy, maintenance, and supervision—must fall below the fully loaded cost of a human worker performing the same task. At a $20,000 price point and a conservative three-year operational life, a humanoid robot that works 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with no benefits, no workers' compensation, and no labor disputes, costs under $1 per productive hour before energy and maintenance. The U.S. federal minimum wage is $7.25; the median warehouse worker earns roughly $19. The threshold is not approaching. For structured tasks in controlled environments, it has already been crossed. The transition from "interesting pilot program" to "why would we ever hire a human for this" happens not gradually but as a step function once reliability in a given task category exceeds approximately 95%—the point at which supervision costs drop below the savings on labor. That is the number to watch.

China's coordinated industrial policy and the cost reductions documented above suggest the reliability threshold will be crossed across broader task categories on the Chinese manufacturing timeline rather than the American one.

### The China Factor Changes Everything

China recorded over 610 robotics investment deals in the first nine months of 2025, totaling $7 billion—a 250% increase year-over-year. China controls 63% of key companies in the global humanoid robot component supply chain. The auto giants already pivoting to humanoid programs—BYD, XPeng, Geely, and the others described in the previous section—are leveraging existing manufacturing expertise, supply chains, and factory floor experience.

China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued guidelines targeting a full humanoid robot innovation system by 2025 and deep integration into the real economy by 2027. This is the EV playbook applied to robotics: state support, dozens of new entrants, rapid scaling, and cost leadership.

The geopolitical dimension compounds the economic disruption question: even if the United States chose to slow deployment, China's pace would continue.
