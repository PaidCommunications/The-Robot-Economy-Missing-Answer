# The Hard Problems: Scarcity, Power, and the Transition

The deflation promise has limits. The optimistic case says that when robots handle agriculture, construction, manufacturing, and transport, the cost of goods crashes toward the cost of raw materials plus energy. A house costs almost nothing to build. Food costs pennies. In that world, even a modest UBI buys a comfortable life.

This is plausible for manufactured goods. It is not plausible for the things that actually consume most household budgets. Land in desirable locations is fixed-supply. A robot can build a house cheaply, but the lot in Austin or Bend or Brooklyn still costs what the market will bear. If anything, wealth concentration from automation could increase real estate prices in desirable areas as capital owners bid up scarce positional goods. Healthcare costs are driven as much by regulatory capture, administrative overhead, and the inherent complexity of human biology as by labor costs. Energy, which powers the entire automated economy, faces its own massive supply constraints.

The economy likely bifurcates into an "automated sector" where prices fall dramatically and a "scarce sector"—housing, energy, healthcare, land, status goods, human-performed services—where prices remain high or increase. Your standard of living in this world depends entirely on the ratio of your spending in each sector.

This has a direct implication for policy design that most UBI advocates have not confronted: if scarce-sector prices dominate household budgets, cash-only UBI becomes a treadmill. You hand people $1,000 a month; landlords and healthcare systems absorb the increase; real purchasing power barely moves. The mechanistic alternatives are not mysterious—they are just politically harder than writing checks. Universal basic services (publicly provided housing, healthcare, and transit) attack the scarce sector directly. Supply expansion through zoning reform, accelerated permitting, and public construction programs increases the denominator. Price and rent stabilization prevents the scarce sector from simply capturing the transfer. A serious proposal needs to specify which combination it relies on. "Cash plus hope" is not a mechanism.

The tax base may evaporate—and what remains may be unenforceable. Most UBI proposals assume fat corporate profits available to be taxed. But if automation drives marginal costs toward zero and competition forces prices down, then revenues shrink, profits compress, and the "automation profits tax" yields far less than projected—unless monopoly power persists. The problem runs deeper than shrinking profits: if the winners of automation no longer need a mass labor force *and* potentially no longer need a mass consumer base, they will optimize for jurisdiction shopping. Intellectual property can move. Transfer prices can move. Production, increasingly, can move. A "robot tax" based on corporate profits is the weakest possible handle—it is precisely the handle that multinational tax arbitrage has already eroded to near-uselessness in the digital economy.

The durable handles are the ones attached to things that cannot move: land value, energy grid access, resource extraction, electromagnetic spectrum, permitted mining and water rights, compute at scale (which requires physical data centers with physical power connections), import/border adjustments, and the licensing of deployment at scale within a jurisdiction. These are the chokepoints where the state retains leverage regardless of corporate structure. The sustainable tax base shifts toward taxing these scarce inputs and rents—not because it is ideologically preferable, but because it is the only base that survives in a world where profits, revenue, and corporate domicile are all optimizable. The firms do not need to "agree" to be taxed. They need market access, energy hookups, legal protections, procurement contracts, and liability regimes. That is where compliance lives.

The ownership question is more important than the tax question. The most stable solution to funding a post-labor economy is not a perpetual political fight over tax rates. It is changing who owns the automated capital. A sovereign wealth fund that holds broad equity in the companies benefiting from publicly funded AI research—and nearly all of them benefit from publicly funded research—converts UBI from a redistributive transfer into a dividend on public investment. Alaska's Permanent Fund and Norway's Government Pension Fund provide working models. The question is whether this ownership stake gets established during the transition, when the leverage still exists, or after the concentration is irreversible, when it doesn't.

If you remember one thing from this section, remember the three-legged stool. **Cash** (UBI or equivalent) provides demand and dignity. **Services** (publicly provided housing, healthcare, transit, energy) insulate households from the scarce sector that cash alone cannot solve. **Ownership** (a public equity stake in automated production) makes the arrangement self-funding and non-repealable—a tax can be voted away; an ownership stake compounds. Any proposal that rests on only one leg will fall over. Cash without services is a treadmill. Services without cash is paternalism. Either without ownership is a perpetual political fight that the owners of capital will eventually win.
