### Summary

Every major AI company is building toward a future where robots perform most economically productive labor. The explicit goal—artificial general intelligence paired with physical automation—would break the circular flow of wages, consumption, and revenue that sustains modern economies. This article examines why the proposed solutions (UBI, "abundance") remain slogans rather than plans, maps the embodiment pipeline from hardware to intelligence to deployment, surveys the policy responses now emerging, and poses ten direct questions—eight specific to each leader's business trajectory, two addressed to all of them simultaneously—to the eight architects with the most influence over how this transition unfolds. The core argument: the gap between the speed of technological deployment and the speed of institutional adaptation is the defining problem of the next two decades, and the architects of this transition owe the public mechanistic answers, not optimism.

## The Catch-22

Here is the simplest version of the problem. In our current economy, money moves in a circle: companies pay humans wages to produce goods, humans use those wages to buy the goods, and companies use that revenue to pay wages again. Every serious AI company on earth is working to remove the first step—wages—from this loop. Not partially. Completely. The explicit goal is artificial general intelligence and physical automation sophisticated enough to perform virtually all economically productive labor.

If you succeed, the second step—consumption—becomes impossible for most people. The third step—revenue—collapses. Your robot armies stand idle in warehouses full of goods that nobody can afford to buy. This is not a novel observation. Economists have been writing about it for decades. What is novel is the timeline. We are no longer debating whether this transition will happen. The people building these systems say it will happen within ten to twenty years. Some say sooner.

And yet, when you press the leaders of the frontier AI companies—the people whose work will trigger this disruption—for specifics on how the economic transition will actually work, you get remarkably thin answers. You get "universal basic income" offered as a phrase, not a plan. You get vague gestures toward "abundance." You get philosophical optimism untethered from mechanism. To be fair, some policy responses are now emerging—robot tax proposals, guaranteed income pilot programs, regulatory frameworks in Europe. But the gap between the scale of what is being built and the scale of what is being prepared remains vast.

This article is an attempt to move past the hand-waving. It lays out the real mechanics of the problem, stress-tests the proposed solutions, and then asks direct questions of the people who have the most influence over how this unfolds.
