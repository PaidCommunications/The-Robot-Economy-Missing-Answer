# Questions for the Architects

The following questions are directed at the eight individuals with the most influence over how this transition unfolds. Each receives the full document, including every other leader's questions. This is deliberate. The answers—or the silences—are a matter of public concern.

Each leader first faces a question specific to their company's trajectory—a question only they can answer. Following those, two questions are addressed to all eight simultaneously. These are the questions this entire essay converges on.

### To Elon Musk — Tesla / Optimus, xAI, SpaceX

You have called Optimus "the infinite money glitch" and described its scaling dynamics as "a supernova"—three exponentials multiplied recursively, with the robot building the robot. You have said that "pure AI, pure robotics corporations will far outperform any corporations that have humans in the loop" and that "this will happen very quickly." You have outlined a path from one million units per year to ten million to a billion. You control the most vertically integrated intelligence-to-embodiment pipeline in history: a $1.25 trillion conglomerate spanning reasoning models, robot hardware, custom inference chips, and launch infrastructure. When asked about governance, you said "the biggest danger of AI and robotics going wrong is government" and that "corporations have better morality than the government." When asked about economic policy, you proposed DOGE spending cuts to "buy time" for AI and robots to arrive. You described the most consequential economic transition in human history and proposed no mechanism for distributing its proceeds. Where is the plan for the humans who are not in the loop?

### To Jensen Huang — Nvidia

Nvidia occupies every layer of the embodied AI stack simultaneously: the GPUs that train robot foundation models, the Omniverse and Isaac simulation platforms (which generated 780,000 synthetic training trajectories in eleven hours), the GR00T humanoid foundation model (iterated from N1 to N1.6 in six months and open-sourced), the Newton physics engine, and the Jetson Thor edge computing hardware. You are building what may become the "Android of robotics"—the open platform layer that any hardware manufacturer can adopt. By compressing the robot training cycle from years to days, Nvidia is also compressing the window for economic and political adaptation. Does Nvidia have any position on whether this acceleration should be modulated—or is maximum speed the default assumption, and if so, what is Nvidia's plan for the institutions that cannot keep pace?

### To Demis Hassabis — Google DeepMind

In twelve months, DeepMind went from launching Gemini Robotics to deploying Gemini Robotics 1.5—an agentic vision-language-action model where robots plan multi-step tasks, search the internet for information, and explain their reasoning while acting. The on-device variant learns new tasks from as few as 50 to 100 demonstrations. The model is available to partners including Boston Dynamics, Agility Robotics, and Apptronik, and to any developer via the Gemini API. This is the bridge technology that converts hardware platforms into genuinely capable autonomous workers. What is DeepMind's internal timeline for when these models reach the reliability threshold for unsupervised commercial deployment at scale—and as these models become available to any robotics company through the API, does safety governance end at the API boundary, or does DeepMind maintain oversight of downstream physical deployments?

### To Brett Adcock — Figure AI

Figure AI's valuation rose from $2.6 billion to $39 billion in eighteen months. You exited your OpenAI partnership citing a "major breakthrough" in in-house AI, vertically integrating with Helix—a proprietary vision-language-action model running at 200 Hz motor control. BotQ is operational with 12,000-unit annual capacity and a stated path to 100,000 robots over four years. BMW and a second major U.S. customer are paying. Figure 03 is designed for home environments—soft materials, foam coverings, washable textiles—making it a household replacement for human labor in the most intimate setting possible, available at $1,000 per month through Robot-as-a-Service. What is Figure's specific timeline for deployment at a scale that measurably displaces human workers—and what does Figure believe its responsibility is to the workers displaced by that deployment?

### To Mark Zuckerberg — Meta

In February 2025, Meta launched a dedicated robotics division led by Marc Whitten, former CEO of GM's Cruise, with the stated goal of developing "consumer humanoid robots" powered by Llama. Simultaneously, Meta's open-source Llama models can already be paired with commercially available robot hardware—any developer can download Llama and use it to control a sub-$5,000 Unitree R1. This creates conditions for rapid, decentralized deployment that is far harder to regulate than proprietary systems. No other company is simultaneously building consumer humanoid robots *and* open-sourcing the intelligence layer that enables anyone else to do the same. What is Meta's position on the tension between open-source AI and managed deployment of physically embodied systems—and does Meta bear responsibility for downstream robotic applications built on its open-source models?

### To Sam Altman — OpenAI

OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit with the mission of ensuring AGI benefits all of humanity. Each corporate restructuring has moved the economic benefits further from public ownership. Meanwhile, OpenAI's robotics investments—Figure AI, 1X Technologies—are structured as standard venture investments with returns flowing to OpenAI's corporate entity, not to any public trust. Figure AI's valuation increased fifteenfold; 1X opened consumer preorders for a home humanoid at $20,000 or $499 per month. OpenAI has rebuilt its own robotics team, hired Caitlin Kalinowski to lead hardware, and filed trademark applications referencing humanoid robots. How do you reconcile the progressive privatization of AGI's economic upside—now extending into physical automation—with the founding mission of universal benefit? And how does "universal basic compute" work in a world where compute is not a digital abstraction but the control layer for physical robots that perform most productive labor?

### To Dario Amodei — Anthropic

In January 2026, your essay "The Adolescence of Technology" diagnosed the problem this article describes in your own words: 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs eliminated within five years, a permanent "underclass" sorted by cognitive capacity, wealth concentration exceeding the Gilded Age, and a disruption categorically different from any previous technological revolution because AI is a "general labor substitute" with full cognitive breadth. You called for government intervention through progressive taxation and announced that Anthropic's seven cofounders have pledged 80% of their wealth—roughly $21 billion—to philanthropy. But your diagnosis describes a structural crisis, while your remedies are voluntary (philanthropy) and unspecified (progressive taxation without a rate, mechanism, or timeline). Meanwhile, Anthropic's models are available via API to any robotics company, extending the displacement you describe from cognitive tasks into physical labor—without Anthropic deploying a single robot. Against the five structural requirements in this article, does your proposal constitute a plan or a gesture—and does Anthropic's responsible scaling framework extend to embodied AI applications built on its models?

### To Jeff Bezos — Amazon, Blue Origin, Investor

Amazon deployed its one millionth robot in July 2025 across over 300 facilities worldwide, acquired Covariant's AI team, and developed DeepFleet—a generative AI foundation model for coordinating robot fleets.[^27] Amazon is simultaneously one of the world's largest employers (over 1.5 million people) and one of the most aggressive deployers of automation designed to replace those same employees. The robot-to-human ratio in Amazon's fulfillment network is approaching parity. Your personal investment portfolio spans the rest of the pipeline: Figure AI (humanoid hardware), Physical Intelligence (robot foundation models). You are positioned to profit at every layer of the stack that automates physical labor. What is Amazon's internal timeline for majority-automated fulfillment operations—and given your position across the entire embodied AI pipeline, what is your view on whether the public should hold an equity stake in the systems that will perform the labor the public used to perform?

### To All Eight

The individual questions above are specific. The two that follow are not. They are the questions this entire essay converges on, and they are addressed to all eight of you simultaneously—because the problem they describe is not any single company's to solve, and the silence around them is collective.

**Q1. The Feedback Loop.** Every company represented here depends on mass consumer purchasing power—whether through car sales, advertising revenue, cloud services, robot subscriptions, or e-commerce. Every company represented here is building technology designed to eliminate the wage income that generates that purchasing power. This is the circular flow problem described in Section I, applied to your own balance sheets. At what point does the automation you are building begin to undermine the consumer economy your revenue depends on? Have you modeled this feedback loop—and if so, what did the model show?

**Q2. The Plan.** This article proposes five structural requirements for a credible transition: an automatic income floor scaled to scarce-sector costs, scarce-sector stabilization, public ownership distribution, enforceable tax handles anchored to immovable assets, and deployment governance with mandatory liability. Policy responses are emerging—robot tax proposals, guaranteed income pilots, the EU AI Act, sovereign wealth fund concepts—but none are remotely proportional to what is coming. You have more knowledge, more resources, and more influence over the timeline than any policymaker. What is your specific, mechanistic plan for the economic transition your technology will cause? Not a philosophy. Not a slogan. Not "abundance." A plan—with mechanisms, timelines, and commitments that can be measured against the five requirements above. To be concrete: a mechanistic answer means a public commitment to at least one ownership mechanism (sovereign wealth fund contribution, equity share, licensing dividend), a published deployment governance standard (liability, auditability, incident reporting), and a stated position on automatic stabilizers tied to labor-market triggers. Anything less is not an answer. It is a press release.
