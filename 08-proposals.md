# What Is Actually Being Proposed—and Why It Is Not Enough

It would be dishonest to claim that nobody is working within that solution space. Several concrete policy responses have emerged in 2025 and early 2026. The problem is not the absence of proposals. It is the chasm between their scale and the scale of the disruption they are meant to address.

**Robot tax proposals.** In October 2025, Senate Democrats led by Senator Sanders released a HELP Committee report proposing an automation excise tax on companies integrating AI, with the report estimating AI could replace approximately 100 million U.S. jobs within a decade.[^22] UAW President Shawn Fain called for a robot tax at CES 2026, explicitly linking it to the displacement threatened by Tesla's Optimus production announcement. The European Parliament has debated similar measures since 2017. None of these proposals have passed. The political opposition from the technology industry is intense, and the counterargument—that taxing automation slows deployment and advantages China—carries significant weight in Congress, particularly among Republicans.

**Guaranteed income pilots.** The Guaranteed Income Pilot Program Act (H.R. 5830), introduced by Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman, authorizes $495 million annually for five years for a nationwide pilot.[^23] Representative Rashida Tlaib's BOOST Act proposes a $250 per month refundable tax credit. Over 150 mayors have joined Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, normalizing unconditional cash transfers as a municipal policy tool. The Marshall Islands introduced a national UBI scheme in November 2025, and Ireland is making permanent its Basic Income for the Arts program in 2026.[^24] These are real experiments. They are also orders of magnitude smaller than what full automation would require. Andrew Yang's proposal of $1,000 per month for every American adult was estimated at $2.8 to $3.0 trillion annually. Current pilots operate at the scale of millions, not trillions.

**Regulatory frameworks.** The EU AI Act reaches full applicability on August 2, 2026, classifying AI systems used in employment decisions as "high-risk" and requiring transparency, human oversight, and conformity assessments. The European Commission has begun evaluating whether mass-market humanoid robots should be categorized under the Act's most stringent requirements.[^25] In the United States, no comparable federal framework exists. Individual states have begun regulating AI in hiring, but nothing addresses the broader displacement question. China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued humanoid robot deployment guidelines, but these focus on industrial coordination, not worker protection.

**Sovereign wealth fund concepts.** Sam Altman's "American Equity Fund" proposal—where large AI companies and landholders contribute approximately 2.5% of their value annually to a citizen dividend fund, modeled on Alaska's Permanent Fund—is the most prominent version of the ownership-based approach this article advocates.[^26] It remains a concept, not legislation. No major AI company has endorsed a binding version of this model, and no member of Congress has introduced a bill to implement it.

The pattern is consistent across all of these proposals: the diagnosis is increasingly accurate, but the medicine is too small and too slow. A $495 million pilot program is a rounding error against a transition that could affect tens of millions of jobs. A robot tax faces the same political headwinds that have blocked carbon taxes for decades. The EU AI Act regulates process and transparency but does not address the distributional question. And the sovereign wealth fund concept—arguably the most structurally sound proposal—exists only as a thought experiment offered by a CEO whose company's own corporate restructuring has moved progressively away from public ownership.

But even if institutions move too slowly, people do not wait to be rescued.

### What People Actually Do

These proposals address the institutional question: what should governments do? But there is a ground-level question they leave untouched: what will people actually do?

When wage employment contracts, people do not sit idle and wait for transfers. They adapt—and their adaptations reshape the economy from the bottom up. They grow food. They repair what they own instead of replacing it. They build local exchange networks: barter, time banks, mutual credit, community currencies. They form cooperatives for childcare, eldercare, tool-sharing, and housing. They make things for themselves and for each other through channels that never touch a cash register or a logistics network. This is not speculation. It is a documented feature of every major economic contraction in modern history—Depression-era mutual aid societies, post-Soviet dacha farming that provided 40–50% of Russia's food calories in the 1990s, Argentina's *trueque* barter clubs that reached six million participants after the 2001 collapse, the surge in community gardens and mutual aid networks during COVID.

The scale of this behavioral shift matters for two reasons the macro-economic analysis tends to miss.

**First, it is what actually breaks the demand model for mass retail.** The income loss is the trigger, but the behavioral response is the structural change. When tens of millions of people redirect their energy toward self-provision, repair, local production, and mutual exchange, the addressable market for Amazon, Walmart, and every mass retailer contracts not just because people have less money but because they *need less from the commercial supply chain*. The "infinite aisle" shrinks to essentials. Product variety collapses. Durability replaces disposability—you repair the vacuum instead of clicking "Buy Now," because the person down the street who can fix it is more accessible than the money to replace it. The entire disposable-goods economy, which depends on high throughput, stable cash flow, and cheap logistics, loses its demand floor. The stores that survive shift from serving wants to serving needs. The ones that don't become scrap material for the communities that repurpose them.

**Second, this parallel economy is where most people find purpose.** The policy discussion treats displaced workers as a problem to be solved—a population that needs income, services, and stability. That framing is correct but incomplete. People are not passive recipients of transfers. They are producers, makers, caregivers, growers, fixers, teachers, artists, and neighbors. In a world where the automated economy handles industrial production and the state handles distribution, the *human* economy—local, physical, relational—becomes where most people actually live their lives. Growing food is not just a calorie strategy; it is an organizing principle for time, skill, and community. Repair culture is not just thrift; it is a knowledge economy that values competence over credentials. Art, music, craft, and local food are not hobbies; they are the basis of exchange in a world where your labor is no longer priced by an employer.

This is not romanticism. The parallel economy has hard limits. You cannot homestead antibiotics, electricity, or semiconductors. Dense urban populations cannot grow meaningful calories in apartments—creating a geographic divide between communities with land access and those entirely dependent on the distribution system. Barter is inefficient at scale; local currencies partially solve this but never fully replace a functioning monetary system. The parallel economy supplements the macro-economy. It does not replace it.

But it changes who needs what from whom. And that reshapes every institution built on the assumption that people are primarily consumers rather than producers. The big-box stores, the same-day delivery networks, the entire infrastructure of mass retail—all of it was built for a population that earns wages, spends wages, and defines its material life through purchasing. When that population starts making, growing, fixing, and trading instead, the commercial landscape doesn't just contract. It reorganizes around a fundamentally different relationship between people and goods.

### The Minimum Viable Answer

If this article is right that the missing element is *mechanism*—institutional answers, not individual adaptation—then it is fair to specify what an adequate mechanism must contain. Any credible answer to the robot economy transition—from a policymaker, a CEO, or anyone else claiming to have one—must address at least these five structural requirements:

1. **Income floor.** A mechanism that provides purchasing power to people who cannot sell their labor. This can be cash (UBI), services (universal basic services), or a hybrid—but it must be automatic (triggered by economic conditions, not by a congressional vote after the damage is done) and scaled to the cost of living in the scarce sector, not just the automated sector.

2. **Scarce-sector stabilization.** A mechanism that prevents housing, healthcare, energy, and land costs from absorbing the entire income floor. This means some combination of supply expansion (zoning, permitting, public construction), price stabilization (rent controls, rate regulation), and direct public provision. Cash alone is a treadmill if the scarce sector captures the transfer.

3. **Ownership distribution.** A mechanism that gives the public an equity stake in automated production, not just a claim on its tax revenue. Sovereign wealth funds, public equity requirements for companies above a certain automation threshold, or mandatory profit-sharing structures. The distinction matters: a tax can be repealed; an ownership stake compounds.

4. **Enforceable tax handle.** A tax base anchored to things that cannot be relocated or arbitraged: land value, energy grid access, resource extraction rights, spectrum, compute infrastructure, deployment licensing, and border adjustments. Profit-based taxation is the weakest handle in a world where profits, IP, and corporate domicile are all optimizable.

5. **Deployment governance.** Standards for embodied AI safety, mandatory liability insurance for autonomous physical systems, deployment licensing, auditability requirements, and a clear legal framework for harm caused by robots operating in public and private spaces. The EU AI Act is a starting point; the United States has nothing comparable.

These requirements are not all needed at once. They activate in sequence as the transition unfolds:

**Phase A — Wage Compression (2025–2032):** The income floor and automatic stabilizers must be enacted *before* mass displacement, not after. This is the legislative window. Ownership stakes must be established during this phase, while governments still have leverage and companies still need public infrastructure, market access, and regulatory approval. The tax base begins shifting toward immovable handles—land value, energy grid access, deployment licensing. Deployment governance frameworks are drafted and piloted.

**Phase B — General Deployment (2032–2040):** Ownership distribution ramps as automation scales. Scarce-sector controls harden: public housing construction, healthcare provision, and energy infrastructure expand to prevent the automated sector's deflation gains from being captured by the scarce sector. The automatic stabilizers enacted in Phase A activate as labor-market indicators cross their pre-set thresholds—without requiring a congressional vote.

**Phase C — Post-Labor Baseline:** The income floor becomes a permanent dividend funded by the compounding returns of the public ownership stake plus immovable-asset taxation. Universal basic services provide the scarce-sector insulation that cash alone cannot. The governance framework matures into standing law.

The critical insight is that Phase A is the only phase where political action is feasible at the speed required. By Phase B, the displacement is underway and the political dynamics shift—companies have more leverage, displaced workers have less, and emergency measures replace deliberate design. Everything that matters must be enacted or irrevocably committed during the wage-compression window. That window is open now.

Any answer that addresses fewer than three of these five is not a plan. It is a gesture. The questions that follow should be read against this checklist. Policy responses are emerging, but they are not remotely proportional to what is coming. The architects of the transition are in the best position to say whether they believe these efforts are sufficient, whether they would support more aggressive measures, and if not, what their alternative is.
